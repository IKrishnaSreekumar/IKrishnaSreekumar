# 💫About Me :
Hi, I am Krishna. 

📘Third year computer science student 

🌿focusing on web dev using MERN stack

🐾Interest in socially relevant projects and project management roles 

But these are all very vague and general information. If I had to describe myself in  one sentence, I would say that I am someone who is interested in exploring.

🔎Explorer

I'll explain. 
The three years in college has been with a lot of lessons that go way beyond 5 semesters worth. I have built presentational skills, confidence, developed leadership qualities and discovered that mathematics is the skill of transformation.  
And at every point of exploration, the experiences it brings acts as an alchemist for me.
